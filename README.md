# MNIST-ML-Model

## About
This repository contains the source code for a machine learning model that classifies handwritten digits. The model is implemented in Python using PyTorch and trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Files

- **MNIST_Classification_Model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the machine learning model. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- **MNIST_Model_Parameters.pt**: The saved parameters (weights and biases) of the trained model. This file can be used for inference on new data without retraining the model.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mirza-Abbas/MNIST-ML-Model
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd MNIST-ML-Model
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook MNIST_Classification_Model.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.
